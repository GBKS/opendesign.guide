# Build Your Presence

Contributing to open source is fundamentally about making meaningful improvements to projects you care about. As you contribute, you naturally develop relationships and build credibility within the community. While traditional "personal branding" might feel at odds with open source values, thoughtfully sharing your work and engaging with others can help you have a bigger impact and create more opportunities to do meaningful design work.

## Working in Public

Open source development happens in the open, creating natural opportunities for others to see your work. Your contributions - whether they're design improvements, documentation updates, or thoughtful discussions in issues - become part of the public record. This transparency allows others to learn from your process and builds trust over time.

Transparency results in a type of organic self-promotion, so consider how you can make your work more accessible and useful to others. A well-organized portfolio showing your contributions, clear documentation [C7](/7-design-for-collaboration#documentation-that-fits){:class='chapter-link'} of your design decisions [C5](/5-design-process#community-led-design-approaches){:class='chapter-link'}, or blog posts explaining your problem-solving process can help others learn and potentially contribute themselves.

Much work happens in publicly accessible places, but that does not mean it is automatically visible to others. So you may consider, for example, maintaining a public design journal or work log where you collect and document your ongoing contributions and insights. Two examples are [Christoph](https://gbks.substack.com){:target="_blank"} and [Mogashni](https://mogashni.substack.com){:target="_blank"} from the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design/){:target="_blank"}, who publish regular updates about their work, creating valuable resources for others interested in similar projects.

## Sharing Your Process

Writing about your experiences in open source can be incredibly valuable for the community. Instead of just showing final results, consider documenting your journey - the problems you encountered, the approaches you tried, and what you learned along the way. This kind of sharing helps others avoid similar pitfalls and builds collective knowledge.

When writing about your work, focus on being helpful rather than promotional. For instance, you might write a guide on "How to Start with Design" in your project, based on your experiences, or share case studies of specific design challenges you've tackled. The goal is to contribute to the community's knowledge base while naturally demonstrating your expertise.

## Building Relationships

Open source thrives on collaboration and relationships [C4](/4-collaborative-workflows){:class='chapter-link'}. These connections grow organically through your contributions - discussing design work, reviewing proposed changes, or helping others with their questions. Focus on being genuinely helpful and engaged rather than networking for its own sake.

There are many ways to connect with others in the open source community. You might join project-specific chat channels, participate in community calls, or attend conferences and meetups (consider presenting your work as well). Organizations like [Open Source Design](https://opensourcedesign.net){:target="_blank"} regularly host events and maintain lists of opportunities to get involved. The key is finding communities that align with your interests and where you can make meaningful contributions.

## Finding Your Path

Every designer's journey in open source is unique. Some focus deeply on specific projects, becoming core contributors [C10](/10-advanced-topics#leading-design-initiatives){:class='chapter-link'} over time. Others work across multiple projects, bringing fresh perspectives to different communities. What matters is finding ways to contribute that align with your skills and interests, and the community's needs.

Consider what unique value you can bring to projects. This might be expertise in making complex interfaces more user-friendly, a talent for illustration, or skill in documenting design systems. Let your contributions speak for themselves and give them visibility, rather than trying to create a specific personal brand.

## Growing Career Opportunities

Contributing to open source can create various opportunities for growth. Many companies value open source experience highly [C2](/2-the-designers-role){:class='chapter-link'}, seeing it as evidence of practical skills and ability to collaborate. Your public work becomes a natural portfolio, demonstrating both your design abilities and your approach to problem-solving.

However, it's important to remember that career advancement should ideally be a byproduct of meaningful contribution, not the primary goal. Focus first on making valuable contributions and building strong relationships within the community. The professional opportunities often follow naturally from there.

## Balancing Visibility and Values

While sharing your work and building relationships is important, it's crucial to do so in ways that align with open source values. This means:

- Being transparent about your process and decisions
- Giving credit generously to others who contribute or inspire your work
- Focusing on the collective success of projects rather than personal recognition
- Staying humble and open to feedback and alternative approaches

Remember, in open source, your reputation grows through consistent, valuable contributions and positive interactions with the community. Let your work speak for itself, and focus on being a reliable, helpful member of the projects you care about.

## Looking Forward

As you continue your journey in open source design, keep in mind that building presence in the community is a gradual process. Focus on making meaningful contributions, sharing knowledge that helps others, and building genuine relationships. Your influence and opportunities will grow naturally from there.

Whether you're just starting out or are already deeply involved in open source, there's always room to grow and new ways to contribute. Stay curious, keep learning, and most importantly, keep contributing to the projects and communities you care about.
