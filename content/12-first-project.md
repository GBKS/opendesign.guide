# Your First Project

Now that we've covered all the key aspects of contributing to open source projects as a designer, it's time to put your skills into practice. This first project will guide you through making a significant design contribution to an open source project of your choice.

## Step 1: Choosing a Project

First, you need to find a project to contribute to. Here's how to go about it:

1. Reflect on your interests: What kind of project do you care about? It could software-related, like a text editor or game engine, a physical product, or a completely different creative endeavor.
1. Assess your skills: What type of design work do you feel most confident doing? UI design? Icon creation? User research?
1. Look for opportunities and projects that interest you and seem to need design help: 
   - Browse open source platforms, like GitHub
   - Look into training programs, like [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/organizations), and [Open Source Design Jobs](https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/)
   - Join design communities and follow open-source designers on social media
   - Contact designers directly and ask them about opportunities (for example via [ADPList](https://adplist.org/explore/design))
   - Or ask friends about their favorite open-source software

1. Check the project's openness to contributions: Look for design documentation or CONTRIBUTING.md file or similar documentation [C3](/3-getting-started#understanding-project-structures){:class='chapter-link'} about how to get involved.
1. Start small: For your first major contribution, it's often best to choose a medium-sized project rather than a huge one like Linux or Firefox.

Remember, it's okay to take your time with this step. Finding the right project is crucial for a good experience.

## Step 2: Understanding the Project

Once you've chosen a project, dive in and learn about it:

1. **Install and use the software:** Get familiar with it from a user's perspective.
1. **Read the documentation:** Understand the project's goals, target users, and current state.
1. **Look at past contributions:** See what kind of design work has been done before.
1. **Join the community:** Introduce yourself on the project's chat, forum, or mailing list.
1. **Identify pain points:** As you use the software, note any usability issues or areas for improvement.
1. **Get support:** Bring in other designers to collaborate and support you if you'd like.

Take notes during this process. Your observations will be valuable when you start designing. For example, if you can't find good design documentation, your may start to contribute by addressing this.

## Step 3: Proposing Your Contribution

Now that you understand the project, it's time to propose your design contribution:

1. **Choose your focus:** Based on your skills and the project's needs, decide what you want to work on. It could be a redesign of a specific feature, a new set of icons, a usability study, or something else.
1. **Draft a proposal:** Write up your idea, including:
   - The problem you're addressing
   - Your proposed solution
   - How it aligns with the project's goals
   - A rough timeline for the work
1. **Get feedback:** Share your proposal with the community. Be open to suggestions and be prepared to revise your plans.
1. **Finalize your plan:** Once you have community buy-in, refine your proposal into a concrete plan of action.

Adjust the steps as needed. Small contributions and projects don't require extensive proposals or processes. Remember, communication is key in open source. Keep the community updated as you work.

## Step 4: Doing the Design Work

This is where you put all your skills into practice:

1. **Research:** If needed, do user research to inform your design decisions.
1. **Sketch and ideate:** Come up with multiple possible solutions to the problem.
1. **Create mockups or prototypes:** Use the tools you're comfortable with to visualize your ideas.
1. **Apply project standards:** Make sure your work fits with any existing style guides or design patterns.
1. **Document your process:** Keep notes on your decisions and rationale.
1. **Seek feedback early and often:** Share works-in-progress with the community and iterate based on feedback.

Tailor this design process to the situation.

## Step 5: Presenting Your Work

Once your design work is complete, it's time to present it to the project:

1. **Prepare your files:** Make sure all your design files are well-organized and in appropriate formats. Ask other contributors what works best for them.
1. **Write up your contribution:** Explain your design decisions, how you addressed the original problem, and any technical considerations for implementation.
1. **Create a pull request or equivalent:** Follow the project's process for submitting contributions.
1. **Be responsive:** Answer questions and be open to making revisions based on community feedback.
1. **Help with implementation:** If possible, assist the developers in implementing your design.
1. **Follow up:** How was the response to your changes? Are users happier now?

Your presentation should be clear, professional, and show how your work benefits the project.

## Step 6: Reflection and Documentation

After your contribution is accepted (or even if it isn't), take time to reflect:

1. **Identify lessons learned:** Review your notes. What went well? What would you do differently next time?
1. **Write a case study:** Document the entire process from start to finish. This is great for your portfolio and helpful for other designers.
1. **Share your experience:** Consider writing a blog post or giving a talk about what you learned.
1. **Plan your next steps:** Will you continue contributing to this project? Move on to a new one?

This reflection process is crucial for your growth as an open source designer. Be aware that first contributions may be much harder than the next ones. As your become more familiar with the project, and the other contributors with you, it will become easier.

## Project Timeline

It can be helpful to have a timeline in mind as you start out. Due to how organically many open-source projects collaborate, assume that you may need to adjust it as you go. Here's a simple one you use as a foundation:

- Weeks 1-2: Choose a project and understand it
- Week 3: Propose your contribution
- Weeks 4-6: Do the design work
- Week 7: Present your work and handle feedback
- Week 8: Reflection and documentation

You have most control over your own work timeline, and least control over the parts where you rely on others (like feedback and implementation). Make the most of these dynamics, and as always, clear and regular communication is the key.

## Mentor Evaluation

If you would like feedback, you could ask a mentor or another designer for an evaluation. Here are some criteria they may be looking for:

1. **Choice of project:** Was it a good fit for you and your interests and skillset?
1. **Understanding of the project:** Did you grasp the project's needs and context?
1. **Quality of your design work:** Does it solve a real problem effectively?
1. **Community interaction:** How well did you communicate and handle feedback?
1. **Documentation:** How well did you explain your process and decisions?
1. **Reflection:** How thoughtfully did you analyze your own work and learning?

This type of feedback can be very helpful in speeding up your learning process and finding your place in open-source. If you're comfortable without it, then that's also OK. You are your own boss in open-source.

## Conclusion

This first project is your opportunity to apply everything you've learned about open source design. It might seem challenging, but remember that you have the skills and knowledge to make a real impact. If you have an idea that excited you, you could even start a new project of your own.

Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Open source communities are often very supportive of new contributors who show enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

Good luck with your project! Your contribution, no matter how small it might seem, is valuable. You're not just building your skills and portfolio – you're helping make open source software better for users around the world.

And if you end up creating design proposals, blog posts, or case studies, let us know. We'd love to showcase them here in this guide.
