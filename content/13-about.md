# Hello there

## Our Mission and Purpose

Welcome to our comprehensive curriculum on contributing to open source projects as a designer! Our mission is to empower designers with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make meaningful contributions to the world of open source software.

We believe that design plays a crucial role in the success and adoption of open source projects. By bridging the gap between designers and the open source community, we aim to:

1. Improve the user experience of open source software
2. Make open source projects more accessible to a wider audience
3. Encourage collaboration between designers and developers
4. Foster innovation in open source design
5. Create opportunities for designers to grow their skills and expand their portfolios

This curriculum is designed to guide you through the entire process of contributing to open source projects as a designer, from understanding the basics of open source to making your first contribution and beyond.
